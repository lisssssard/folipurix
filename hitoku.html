          While Hitoku is the youngest in her friend group, she looks even younger than she really is. She is very emotionally distant and hides her
          emotions due to former trauma and emotional abuse. She was assaulted by her father who succumbed to his alcoholism after her mother died
          in a car crash. She once pushed her father away in order to defend herself, making him fall and hit the back of his head. He died afterwards, caused by the lack of medical attention
          and Hitoku barricaded herself in her home for a few months, making her lose weight to an extremely dangerous level. She was too scared to tell anyone that
          she killed her father and, in the end, she had to eat his corpse in order to survive. Afterwards she couldn't stand being at home anymore and 
          started to go to school again. Her friends don't know anything about that.
